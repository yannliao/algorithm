#Divide and Conquer
Divide the complicate problem to many small and fimilar problems, sovle subproblems recursively, and combine result of subproblems to get the result of the original problem.

* Divide: divide the problem into many subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

* Conquer: solve subproblems recursively , mostly useing same method. If the subproblem is small enough then solve it directly. 

* Combine: combine the reuslt of subproblems to get the result of the original one.
